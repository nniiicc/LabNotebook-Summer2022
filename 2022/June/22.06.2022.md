Worked on
- Gigplat
	- Cleaning transcripts. This is proving to be really time-consuming and should consider how to divide this up with LS. The major time suck here is the questions which are not stated clearly, and this impacts the readability and reusability in future work. 
	- Website - need to make decisions and move forward so we can advertise our work across these spaces 
- Hiring 
	- Need to get the budget data from Jenn so I can write an official email on how to find LS for 2022 research scientist position 
- Eva
	- Talked about CDP paper: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cuUhZ0EtIUWh_uUMcQ-B8vQuJ_IoGcC3A8UxaRka4qY/edit#heading=h.u85tcpx3qjdx 

Other things
 - Found a good R library to scrape political candidate information from Ballotpedia 
	 - Design the study and collect the data for 2022 elections on a web-accessibility project [https://github.com/BlakeRMills/2022-Election-Material](https://github.com/BlakeRMills/2022-Election-Material)

To do tomorrow:
- Make summer goals and start a writing habbit 
- Meeting at 11am with Eva and Richard - have notes prepared on potential topics / lectures / labs 
- Get data from Jenn so we can hire 
- Clean transcripts 
- Write out protocol for the web accessability study (need to start early)
- Get a plan in place for website publishing 
- Get more details from RH on summer work - until he gets a draft out need to ask him to work on SOMETHING
