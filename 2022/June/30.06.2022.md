Feedback for Richard: 
- Much of this will turn on the idea of how PIT is scoped
	- Adversarial to whom or what? 
	- What is the purpose of collecting database? 
	- What is the goal?
- I don't like the idea of studying failed PIT projects - there is already a large literature out there about why public technology projects fial, and it seems like a lazy way out of asking more important questions 
- Funding could work - but again, what is the purpose or goal?

	- What about studying something more specific in the way of funding public interest technology research... like the cozy relationship between software / hardware vendors and federal funding agencies?
